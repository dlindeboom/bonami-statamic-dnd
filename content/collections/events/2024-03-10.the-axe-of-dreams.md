  **Synopsis:** Long ago, a mighty warrior named Antares captured the attention of the deities with his martial prowess. Ramlaat, the Horde god, marked Antares, enhancing his violence in battle but claiming his and his descendants' strength for eternity.

  ### The Legend

  Antares's martial feats earned him fame as death's envoy, the bane of hundreds. In his twilight years, he withdrew from the world, dying peacefully among wealth and loved ones. His followers erected a grand sepulcher for him and his legendary axe, which over time, was forgotten.

  ### Collecting the Debt

  Unknown to any, a pact with Ramlaat bound not just Antares but also his lineage. Now, Ramlaat has invoked the terms, with Antares's axe calling out to his kin through powerful dreams.

  #### Reasons to Leave Home

  **Deluded Minds**

  The purest blood of Antares's line feel an inextinguishable urge, a calling to seek the great axe behind Spear Keep. Compelled by this vision, they leave their homes, risking all to heed the dream.

  **Dream of Wealth**

  Others, not of Antares's blood, sense opportunity in the unclaimed tomb. Driven by greed and the promise of untold riches, they join the search, hoping to alter their fates with the wealth that may lie within.

  ### The Call to Adventure

  As the dreams spread, many from Spearhome, regardless of lineage, are drawn to the warrior's resting place. What will they find? Wealth, power, or doom?
