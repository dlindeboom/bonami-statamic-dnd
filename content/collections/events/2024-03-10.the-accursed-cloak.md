  Disaster looms closer in Rivermill as a kobold warchief threatens to attack. Gulduk, the Fire
  Spirit, as he calls himself, commands a large force of kobolds and a few masterless brigands. After the townsfolk of Rivermill refused to comply with the ruinous commands, Gulduk ordered his forces to barricade all roads and force the town to acquiesce. The locals dare not travel west and hope that letters sent to the countess are answered soon. They are at Gulduk’s mercy unless someone swoops in to help.

  **Hooks for you character:**
  **Helping in Time**
  The characters hear that many people have petitioned
  the countess to help Rivermill as kobold brigands threat-
  en to attack. Indigo, from the Zarvish Front, hires the
  characters to travel to Rivermill and fix the situation. He
  hopes to earn the local’s loyalty this way.
  **Hook bonus:**
  You start the adventure with an extra 40gp

  **Just Here for Business**
  The characters were hired by Balder, in Zarveck City to
  escort a caravan to Rivermill and back. 
  During your travels you got ambushed by the kobolds 
  and some of your cargo was stolen by them. Your associate and employee of Balder,
  Harold claims that the return trip will not be allowed by
  the kobolds. Your character must deal with them
  Hook bonus: You start with 1 rumor on the rumor table. This will be provided at the start of the adventure. (Rumors will help with the adventure in someway) 

  **Your own**
  You can think up your own hook why you might be here. But this will not grant any bonus for the start of the adventure.

  **important information:**
  Since we only have 2 hours, I thought it best to skip to the adventuring part of the adventure. Because of this, your characters have already talked to the locals and this is what they have learned:

  The townsfolk in Rivermill realized that opposing the kobold’s unified clan was beyond the scope of what the few local guards could do. Gulduk sent a messenger demanding a harsh payment in gold coins and dry meat. Sustaining this tribute for as few as 3 months
  would ruin Rivermill and doom them to starve in the coming winter. The locals have tried to stall Gulduk by alluding to slow town councils and their inability to decide so promptly. Alas, Gulduk’s patience is running thin. Kobold scouts now patrol the few roads in and out of Riv-
  ermill. The locals dare not travel west and hope that past missives to the countess are answered soon. They are at Gulduk’s mercy unless someone swoops in to help.
