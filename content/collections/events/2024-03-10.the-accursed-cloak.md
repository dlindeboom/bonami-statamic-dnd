  **Location:** Rivermill, a town under threat by Gulduk, the Fire Spirit, and his kobold army. The locals, unable to travel or seek help, are desperate for heroes to intervene.

  ### Adventure Hooks

  #### 1. Helping in Time
  - **Situation:** Rivermill has sought help from the countess as kobold brigands threaten to attack. Indigo of the Zarvish Front hires characters to address the situation, hoping to gain local loyalty.
  - **Bonus:** Begin the adventure with an additional 40gp.

  #### 2. Just Here for Business
  - **Situation:** Hired to escort a caravan to Rivermill, you're ambushed by kobolds, leading to a dire situation as per Harold, Balder's associate. Your task: resolve the kobold issue.
  - **Bonus:** Receive 1 rumor at the adventure's start (beneficial for progression).

  #### 3. Your Own Path
  - **Situation:** Create a unique reason for being in Rivermill. Note: Custom hooks won't provide starting bonuses.

  ### Important Information

  To maximize our limited session time (2 hours), we'll focus on the core adventuring experience. Here's what your characters already know upon arriving in Rivermill:

  - **The Threat:** Gulduk demands unsustainable tributes from Rivermill, threatening its very survival within months.
  - **The Stalemate:** Attempts by the townsfolk to negotiate or stall have failed. Gulduk's patience wears thin, and kobold patrols hinder any travel or communication with the outside world.
  - **The Call to Action:** Without intervention, Rivermill's doom is certain. It's up to brave souls to step forward and save the town.
